# Layton Wiki
This is the repository for the [Layton Fangame](https://github.com/Layton-Fangame/Layton-Fangame) Wiki.

## How to contribute
Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.<br>
Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

You can also simply open an issue with the tag `enhancement`.<br>
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

### Why
The repository is not publicly editable so to add your work to the documents you must:

- Edit the documents.
- Request a "pull request" to add your chenges to the original repository.

### How
1. Click on the `Fork` button.
2. Click on the `main` button then add a name for your new branch.
3. Edit the documents.<br>
	Or create a new one (to add folders, add a `/` âžœ `/theFolder/theNewFile.md`)
4. Click on the `Pull requests` button.
5. Click on the `New pull request` button.
6. Click on the `Create pull request` button.
7. Go to the discord server and inform the programming channel that there is a pull request for the wiki.

## Guidelines
To be as efficient as possible, it is important to have a well-structured table of contents,
that everything is clearly defined, before filling it with google docs.

The objective is to avoid long blocks of text.
